Configuration management is important in software development because it helps teams
control changes to the codebase and project artifacts in an organized way.

It ensures that every change is tracked, documented, and reproducible.

With proper configuration management, developers can work in parallel without
overwriting each other's work, and they can roll back to previous stable versions
when issues occur.

It also helps maintain consistency between development, testing, and production
environments.

This leads to higher software quality, fewer integration problems, and faster,
safer releases.
