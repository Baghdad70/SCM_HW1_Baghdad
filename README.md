## Software Configuration Management Best Practices

- Use version control systems (such as Git) to track all changes to the codebase.
- Create separate branches for new features and bug fixes instead of working directly on the main branch.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages so that changes are easy to understand and trace.
- Keep documentation updated whenever important changes are made to the project.
- Regularly review and merge changes to avoid large and hard-to-manage integrations.
